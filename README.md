# Block Krylov Solvers

Run:

python3 compare.py

to compare all the implementations: all the Python and cpp implementations.

# Immediate TODOs

  ** write my own implementation of GMRES, and compare times with SciPy's GMRES, and think of ways to level-up with it SciPy's solution

  ** add gitignore

  ** enable the possibility to chose between CG and GMRES, and add SciPy's CG
